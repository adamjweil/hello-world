# hello-world
my first test repository

Adam here! I am working on my web-development skills and thought it necessary that I learn how to use GitHub, and all of the awesome features that it has. The project that I have most recently been working on is something called Wayward Mercantile (wywrd.com). It is an undershirt brand, built by cubicle monkeys, for cubicle monkeys. The undershirts we designed are top quality, over tuck-technology, and are offered at the lowest possible price we can (with the goal of not loosing money, of course :/)
